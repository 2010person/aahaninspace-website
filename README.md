# Aahan in Space website
Website for aahaninspace.tk.
# How the website works
I have brought aahaninspace.tk free of Freenom.
The domains nameservers are pointed to CloudFlare (we use the free plan).
From CloudFlare we recieve a number of features including encryption.
We have used CNAME records to point 000webhost to CloudFlare.
We use 000webhost because it is one of the only free web hosting services that host websites coded in PHP.
Here this GitHub repo is basically the websites backup and where we can collaborate to make the website.
We use PHP to program the website (even though GitHub says we use Hack, which is a dialect of PHP).

## Some things about Personal Hypertext Processor (PHP)
We are using PHP 7.2 .
## Some things about HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
We use HTML5 and this is built into PHP 7.2 (which we use)
It is preferred if you keep tags lowercase so...
```
<p>HTML5 is the best HTML version</p>
```
Instead of 
```
<P>HTML5 is the best HTML version</P>
```
It is also preferred if you could start your PHP document (if it contains HTML) with...
```
<!DOCTYPE> html
```
Instead of...
```
<!doctype> html
```
